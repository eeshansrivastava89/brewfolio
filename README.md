# brewfolio

Monorepo for **brewfolio** — a CMS-driven design system for Astro — and its scaffolder.

## Quick start

```bash
npx create-brewfolio
```

Pick a type (portfolio / app / game), answer two prompts, and you'll have a running Astro + Keystatic site using the full design system.

## Packages

| Package | What it is | Published |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| [`brewfolio/`](./brewfolio) | The runtime library: layouts, components, tokens, Keystatic schema | [`brewfolio` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brewfolio) |
| [`packages/create-brewfolio/`](./packages/create-brewfolio) | The interactive scaffolder (the thing `npx` runs) | [`create-brewfolio` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-brewfolio) |

## Three layouts

| Layout | For |
|--------|-----|
| `DashboardLayout` | Personal portfolio sites — 5-pane grid (concepts, projects, writing, analysis, GitHub) |
| `AppLayout` | Tools, dashboards, landing pages — section sequence driven by the `sections` singleton |
| `GameLayout` | Real-time games or live events — main column + leaderboard sidebar |

## Design philosophy

- **Layout is code. Content is CMS.** Astro handles structure and routing; Keystatic owns the content.
- **One schema everywhere.** The full brewfolio Keystatic schema (`projects`, `writing`, `notebooks`, `concepts`, `sections`, `siteConfig`, `timeline`, `about`, `impact`, `secrets`) is re-exported by the package — consuming apps import `collections` and `singletons` and pass them straight through.
- **Tailwind-first.** Utility classes for layout, spacing, color, typography; raw CSS only for things Tailwind can't express (pseudo-element notches, keyframes).
- **Open-source, no SaaS.** Everything runs from local files. No registration, no paid tier.
